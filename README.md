I wanted to create a straight forward, basic token gated website in React. You will want to change the "nftContractAddress" variable to match your NFT access token. You will also want to update the nft_abi.json to reflect the abi of your NFT contract. 

The web app does ENS resolution, and address shortening. At the moment it renders a React component that plays a synthesizer tone using Tone.js.

The "unlockable content" component is the Unlocked.js file.

The NFT that unlocks my content can be found here: [https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x57a00abb471cf26a6acc79c78b3b32f89bdf6edf/1/](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x57a00abb471cf26a6acc79c78b3b32f89bdf6edf/1/)

## Installation

### `yarn install`

To start the app you can run:

Which runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
